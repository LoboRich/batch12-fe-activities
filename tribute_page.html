						Staff Sergeant Hidilyn Francisco Diaz born February 20, 1991, is a Filipino weightlifter and airwoman, the first Filipino to ever win an Olympic gold medal, and an Olympic weightlifting record holder by winning the women's 55 kg category for weightlifting at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
					</p>
					<p>
						In her early weightlifting years, she was a bronze medalist in the 2007 SEA Games in Thailand and achieved 10th place at the 2006 Asian Games in the 53-kilogram class. While she was a student and representing Universidad de Zamboanga, she won two golds and one silver in the Asian Youth/Junior Weightlifting Championship held in Jeonju, South Korea.[7][8][9] She competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics, where she was the youngest competitor in the women's 58-kg category.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the 2016 Summer Olympics, Diaz won the silver medal in the women's 53-kg weight division, ending the Philippines' 20-year Olympic medal drought.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hidilyn Diaz is the fifth of six children of Eduardo and Emelita Diaz. Her father was a tricycle driver before becoming a farmer and a fisherman. She grew up wanting to be a banker and trying several sports, like basketball and volleyball.[13] Her cousin, Allen Jayfrus Diaz, taught her the basics of weightlifting.[14]

						She attended the Universidad de Zamboanga where she pursued a bachelor's degree in computer science. However, Diaz stopped attending the university as a third year irregular student as she found her degree unsuitable for her. She also claimed that it distracted her training. After her success in the 2016 Olympics, Diaz decided to continue her tertiary education and intended to pursue a degree related to sports in Manila.[15]

						In January 2017, Diaz received a scholarship to study business management at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde.[16]

						In 2018, Diaz went on a leave of absence for her schooling as she had focused on Olympic Preparation after winning the Asian Games.[citation needed]

						In 2020, Diaz had re-enrolled into online classes since the Summer Olympics had been postponed to July 2021.[citation needed]

					<b>2008 Summer Olympics</b>
					<p>
						Diaz was selected as a wild card entry to the Summer Olympics by the Philippine Weightlifting Association in early 2008.[17] She is the first female weightlifter to compete for the Philippines in the Olympics, and the sixth weightlifter overall (the first being, Rodrigo del Rosario competing in 1948 London Olympics).[18] Competing in the women's 58-kg class, 17-year-old Diaz lifted 85-kg in the snatch and 107-kg in the clean and jerk for a 192-kg total, breaking the Philippine record that she herself set at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games.[19] Although she placed second to last in a field of 12 weightlifters, her performance was praised and considered promising for her age. Philippine Sports Commission Chairman William Ramirez once commented that she competed there to gain valuable experience and predicted that she would be a strong contender in future competitions.
					</p><br><br>
					
					<b>2012 Summer Olympics</b>
					<p>
						Diaz became the first Filipina weightlifter to compete in two consecutive Olympics, by qualifying in the women's weightlifting under 58 kg through the Continental and World Qualifying Tournaments. She was ranked ninth in her event heading to the Olympics. During the 2012 London Olympics, Diaz was chosen to be the flagbearer during the Opening Ceremony.
					</p>
					<p>
						She was coached by Tony Agustin, and they projected a 225 kg lift, above her personal best of 219 kg.[24] She successfully lifted a personal best of 287 97 kg in the snatch, 12th best among the 19 competitors. However her 118 kg Clean and Jerk was unsuccessful after three attempts. She was one of two competitors (along with Lina Rivas of Colombia) to end with an official result of "Did not finish" (DNF) in the event.

						Diaz (second from left) with Cecil Atilano, Beng Climaco and Nestor Colonia being recognized by Zamboanga City Mayor Mayor Beng Climaco for their performance in the 2015 Asian Weightlifting Championships in Phuket, Thailand
						Hidilyn Diaz weighed around 56.28 kg during her first Olympic campaign, making her the lightest among competitors. Come 2012 Olympics, Hidilyn Diaz increased her weight to 57.70 kg but still struggled making it to the top half of the competition. Trying to improve her chances of landing a podium finish at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Diaz decided to drop weight from under 58 kg to under 53 kg. This proved to be effective as she recently snatched the gold medal in the 1st Southeast Asian Weightlifting Championship in Bangkok.[26] She managed to lift a 98 kg snatch and a 115 kg clean and jerk for a 213 kg total. The same mark is good for 4th place in the 2012 London Olympics.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the Asian Weightlifting Championships, Diaz copped a gold medal in 2015 and a bronze medal in 2016.[13] She also earned three bronze medals for the clean, jerk and snatch events in the 53 kg division of the IWF World Weightlifting Championship held in Houston, Texas on November 22, 2015 to claim a spot in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
					</p>
					<p>
						In March 2016, Diaz dominated the women's 58 kg event of the 2015-16 Philippine National Games National Finals held at Lingayen Town Plaza, Lingayen, Pangasinan, with a 92 kg snatch and 120 kg clean and jerk (new personal best) combined into 212 kg.
					</p>
					<b>2016 Summer Olympics</b>
					<p>
						In the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Diaz competed in her 3rd consecutive Olympics in the women's 53kg weightlifting category with the intention of at least winning a bronze medal.[31] Diaz surpassed her own personal target and won the silver medal at the event, after successfully clinching a lift of 88 kg in her second attempt in snatch event (placed 6th) and 111 kg and 112 kg in the first and second attempts in the clean and jerk event (placed 2nd).[32] This was the first medal for the Philippines in the Summer Olympics after 20 years. This was also the first non-boxing medal for the nation since 1936. Aside from being the first Filipina weightlifter to compete in three consecutive Olympics, she also became the first Filipino woman and the second person from Zamboanga and Mindanao to win an Olympic medal (after Simeon Toribio, bronze medal winner of men's high jump in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games).
					</p>
					<p>
						On August 8, 2016, she returned to her hometown, Zamboanga City and was welcomed as a Hero of the city,[33] She was able to buy land for her sibling and for her gym[13] from receiving numerous incentives from the Philippine president, Philippine Sports Commission and her local city.

					<b>2018 Asian Games</b>
					<p>
						Diaz (third from left), with three other gold medalists (Loisa Kaye Go, Bianca Pagdanganan, and Yuka Saso) for the Philippines at the 2018 Asian Games.
						Diaz participated in the women's 53 kg event in the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.[35] Two months prior to the Asian Games, she recruited Gao Kaowen who was previously coach of the Chinese national women's army team.[36] In the women's 53 kg in the 2018 Asian Games, Diaz had a total lift of 207 kg, beating Turkmenistan's Kristina Shermetova (206 kg) and Thailand's Surodchana Khambao (201 kg) to deliver the Philippines' first gold in the 2018 games,[35][37] as well as the first Filipino weightlifter of any gender to win a gold medal in the Asian Games.
					</p>
					<b>2019</b>
					<p>
						After winning a bronze in the 2017 World Championships, Diaz again got a bronze in the 2019 edition of the same event. She also won a silver in the 2019 Asian Championship, and another gold in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in Manila.
					</p>
					<b>2020</b>
					<p>
						In January 2020, Diaz won the gold medal in the women's 55kg event at the Roma 2020 World Cup in Rome, Italy.
					</p>
					<p>
						2020 Summer Olympics
						On July 26, 2021, Diaz won the gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.[40] This was the first ever gold medal won by a Filipino athlete since the country's first appearance in the Olympics in 1924.[41] She set new Olympic weightlifting records by lifting 127kg in the Clean and Jerk and lifting a total weight of 224 kg.
					</p>
					<p>
						Diaz's achievements at the 2020 Summer Olympics were remarkable, as she was previously stranded in Malaysia from February 2020 until July 2021, due to travel restrictions imposed by governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on guidance by her coach, Gao Kaiwen, Diaz initially went to train in Malaysia in February 2020 because Gao thought it would be better for her as she focused on qualifying for Tokyo. However, once Malaysia implemented its Movement Control Order in April 2020, which closed gyms within the capital region of Kuala Lumpur (Klang Valley), she improvised by using bamboo sticks and large water bottles as makeshift weightlifting equipment.[42][43] In October 2020, she relocated to the southern coastal state of Malacca where they have been living in a house owned by a Malaysian weightlifting official in Jasin.[44][45] However, the Malaysian government later implemented periodic restrictions on gyms and sporting activities within 2021 (to reduce social interaction and contain the spread of the coronavirus), forcing her to work out in the house's sweltering open-air carport in the immediate months prior to the 2020 Summer Olympics.
					</p>
					<p>
						In recognition of winning the first gold medal for the Philippines at any Olympic Games, she was awarded PHP 35.5 million (approximately US$660,000) along with a house and a lot. The financial and asset awards, were jointly given by both the national government and tycoons from the private sector.[50] Under Philippine law, the Philippine Sports Commission guarantees a 10 million-peso incentive for every Olympic gold.
